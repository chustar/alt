metro start is my oldest and most successful project.  
I chose to exhume it first for several reasons:  

1. There's new features in chrome that I/users want to take advantage of.
2. I wrote it with a minimal knowledge of functional programming and javascript.
3. Its probably due a rewrite.

Once I started looking at the code, I was tempted to just jump right into refactoring and rewriting. This was the wrong approach and would not work. I needed constraints.  
I decided on the following as my constraints.
I also thought it might be a cool project to explore converting to typescript/coffeescript.

###Metro Start Refactor Constrains  
* Must be jshint/lint compatible.
* Feature being refactored must have unittests.  
I realize that as an SDET I'm a little late to the unittesting party, but #whatevs.
* No more working in main. Like, seriously.  
* Work must be tracked on github-issues or trello.  
I need to get used to the idea of working against a set of work, not working against an invisible and unquanitifyable list of list.  

So far, because of these, I can't make any changes. Any major issues I find, I simply file a github issue for and move on. I'll get to them once I have 1, 2 and/or 3 (where applicable).
