I wanted to use a linting tool to clean up a project, so the first thing I did was search for "JSLint Raganwald". 

I did this because @raganwald is someone I respect and consider an expert. If I have to choose a linting tool, I should just choose the one he uses.

I think there's often too much configuration in the world, and this is one of the ways I've found to deal with it. Just ask the experts and let them decide for me. Its why I appreciate sites like http://www.wirecutter.com so much:

> Q: Which fridge should I buy?  
A: This one.  
Q: What about all the dohickeys and stuff?  
A: This one's the best.  
Q: What if...  
A: Doesn't matter. Just buy it. Or don't.

 It simplifies things somewhat, but I don't need an experts opinon on which linter to use. They both probably fine. Just pick one and move on. #whatever.
