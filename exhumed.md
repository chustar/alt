There are some projects that I've created and developed for a while and then stopped working on.  
I left them to focus on other things: new projects, work, etc. They worked, I put them out there and they've been somewhat happy.  
I recently started working on another project but had to abandon that one and now am at a loss for something to work on.  
I've decided to exhume those projects and make fixes to them that people have requested for the longest time.

The first one I picked was metro-start. I picked it because its both:  
a. One of the earlies projects I have and;
b. My most "successful" project.

After cloning and syncing, I decided to take a look around the project before making any changes. This involves just wandering around the project and revisiting the design decisions I've made over time.

I feel weird doing this though. On the one hand, I feel smarter, because I can see better and more efficient ways of getting the same results. Even in places where I can't see an efficient change, I know one exists. 
On the other hand, the scope of this project is much bigger than anything I thought I was capable of, especially considering I built it as a junior in college.
I know a lot of this is because it grew organically from doing one thing (here's a list of links with no configurations) but its end result is actually really impressive.  
  
Current day me is very impressed by past me. Did I used to be smarter?
