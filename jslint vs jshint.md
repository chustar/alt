The atom editor's most popular lint tool doesn't have built in support for jslint, but does for jshint. Is it worth trying to add support for JSLint if JSHint works?  
The only real reasons I want to choose JSLint are:  

1. is that I like and respect Douglas Crockford. 
2. I want someone else to tell me what style to code against.
